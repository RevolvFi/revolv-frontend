    <h1 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">New UK Regulations</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The UK financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’), has
      expanded the scope of the financial promotions regime to enhance
      protections for UK users investing in cryptoassets. All cryptoasset firms
      who market to UK consumers will have to comply with the new rules from 8
      October 2023.

    <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Notice to users in the UK</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Due to the potential for losses, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
      considers this investment to be high risk.

        <p class="mt-2">
          The performance of most cryptoassets can be highly volatile, with
          their value dropping as quickly as it can rise. You should be prepared
          to lose all the money you invest in cryptoassets.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The cryptoasset market is largely unregulated. There is a risk of
          losing money or any cryptoassets you purchase due to risks such as
          cyber-attacks, financial crime, and firm failure.

          The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) doesn't protect this
          type of investment because it's not a 'specified investment' under the
          UK regulatory regime—in other words, this type of investment isn't
          recognised as the sort of investment that the FSCS can protect. Learn

        <p class="mt-2">
          There is no guarantee that investments in cryptoassets can be easily
          sold at any given time. The ability to sell a cryptoasset depends on
          various factors, including the supply and demand in the market at that
          time.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Operational failings such as technology outages, cyber-attacks, and
          comingling of funds could cause unwanted delay and you may be unable
          to sell your cryptoassets at the time you want.

        <p class="mt-2">
          Investments in cryptoassets can be complex, making it difficult to
          understand the risks associated with the investment.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          You should do your own research before investing. If something sounds
          too good to be true, it probably is.

        <p class="mt-2">
          Putting all your money into a single type of investment is risky.
          Spreading your money across different investments makes you less
          dependent on any one to do well.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          A good rule of thumb is not to invest more than 10% of your money in
          high-risk investments. Learn more
